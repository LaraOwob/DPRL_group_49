Q. Define an appropriate state space and action space for this problem
    Answer the state space would be the current stock of the product
    The action space is defined by the inventory. If the inventory is zero the only action possible
    is ordering 1 of the product so increasing the current stock. For all the states inbetween 1 and infinity 
    there are two possible actions increasing by ordering more product or decreasing due to demand at that time

2 slight amendments: ? 
1) wouldn't the state space would contain all valid values that current inventory can assume? 
2) we start with 5 items in the inventory. best-case scenario, one item can be added to the inventory at a time. since we have a finite horizon of T = 150, 
the largest value the inventory can assume is 155. 
Resulting in the state space X = {0, ..., (150 + 5)}
