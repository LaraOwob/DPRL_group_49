Q. Define an appropriate state space and action space for this problem
    Answer the state space would be the current stock of the product
    The action space is defined by the inventory. If the inventory is zero the only action possible
    is ordering 1 of the product so increasing the current stock. For all the states inbetween 1 and infinity 
    there are two possible actions increasing by ordering more product or decreasing due to demand at that time
